launch an ec2 micro instance
attach vpc , subnets to it 
make elastic ip as when we stop instance or it crashes or whatever resaon it's ip might change so attaching elastic ip to ec2 makes it permanent.
then go to route 53;

2) Create Route 53 Hosted Zone and note the NS records
Route 53 → Hosted zones → Create Hosted Zone → domain: kanishksaraswat.me.

Copy the 4 NS nameservers Route 53 gives you (you’ll paste them at Namecheap later).

Why: Route 53 lets AWS services and CloudFront integrate cleanly and gives you stable, fast DNS.

 Change your domain registrar nameservers → Route 53
In Namecheap (or your registrar) replace their default nameservers with the 4 Route 53 nameservers.

IMPORTANT: Before switching, optionally create the A record in Route 53 so it resolves immediately after propagation.

Why: Switching NS to Route 53 makes Route 53 authoritative for your domain.

) (Optional) Create Route 53 A record to Elastic IP
In your hosted zone, create an A record:

Name: @

Type: A

Value: <your Elastic IP>

TTL: leave default

Why: This connects kanishksaraswat.me → Elastic IP.
