Option A – AWS Elastic Beanstalk (best for full-stack apps)

Handles provisioning EC2, load balancers, SSL, scaling automatically.

You just push your code; it deploys both frontend and backend.

Easy asf like railway

Option B – AWS EC2 + Manual Setup
Full control over server (install Node, Nginx, Docker, etc.).

You’ll have to manage SSL, scaling, deployments yourself.

More flexible but more work.

So i am proceeding ith option B as i want to learn - 

now there are 2 options in it as well ->
1) host frontend on s3 bucket and then use cloudfront
2) host both backend and frontend on ec2 

-> hosting frontend on s3 bucket is industry level and for production , comparatively easy but as for now i want to learn so
let's go with hosting boht on ec2 so that i can  learn.
